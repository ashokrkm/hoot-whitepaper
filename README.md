Hoot GPUCoinâ„¢ Protocol Network - censorship resistant  distributed computing powered by Block-chain smart contracts 

The emergence of bitcoin and subsequent block-chain technologies has generated a new digital asset class in which scarcity is based on mathematical properties and network compute capacity, leading to a fall of the open web. Through cryptographic verification and game-theoretic equilibrium, block-chain-based digital assets can be created, issued, and transmitted using software.
Hoot GPUCoin aims to build a web scale cryptographically secure distributed computing networking creating the world's first IPCN - Interplanetary Compute Network. 

We propose that decentralizing and democratizing compute using crypto-currencies and making it censorship resistant using block-chain has net positive effects on the world.
