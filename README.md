Hoot GPUcoinâ„¢ Protocol Network - Uncensorable  distributed computing powered by Blockchain smart contracts 

The emergence of bitcoin and subsequent blockchain technologies has generated a new digital asset class in which scarcity is based on mathematical properties and network compute capacity, leading to a fall of the open web. Through cryptographic verification and game-theoretic equilibrium, blockchain-based digital assets can be created, issued, and transmitted using software.
Hoot GPUcoin aims to build a web scale cryptographically secure distributed computing networking creating the world's first IPCN - Interplanetary Compute Network. 

We propose that decentralizing and democratizing compute using cryptocurrencies and making it censorship resistant using blockchain has net positive effects on the world.
