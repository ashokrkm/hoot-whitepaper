Hootcoinâ„¢ Protocol Network - Uncensorable  distributed computing powered by Blockchain smart contracts 

The emergence of bitcoin and subsequent blockchain technologies has generated a new digital asset class in which scarcity is based on mathematical properties and network compute capacity. Through cryptographic verification and game-theoretic equilibrium, blockchain-based digital assets can be created, issued, and transmitted using software.
Hootcoin aims to build a web scale cryptographically secure distributed computing networking creating the worlds first IPCN - Interplanetary Compute Network. 

We propose that decentralizing and democratizing compute using cryptocurrencies and making it uncensorable using blockchain has net positive effects on the world
