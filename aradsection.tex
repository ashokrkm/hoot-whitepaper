Video Ads have been priced historically based on CPM for impressions as it has been nearly impossible to know how much of these video ads lead to a product sale/conversion or if they even positively affect the customer ROI. Viewers do not know what action to take and how to take the said action leaving them to figure out how to follow up on the video ad they just saw, leading to a lot of drop off and lack of performance of these video ads. Hence it has not been easy  to measure effectiveness and performance of the video ads historically.

Using interactive \textbf{Hoot AR} augmented reality  ads with clear
call to actions such as a buy button or rent button below the
interactive Hoot AR ad, sales can be generated right then and there,
after the viewer interacts with the Hoot AR ad. We will be able to
charge based on sales generated from the AR interaction i.e.,
referrals and instead of pricing based on CPM or impressions we can
price based on  cost per referral(\textbf{CPR}). The CPR price becomes
the signal that drives the continuous auction engine that powers the
Hoot ad marketplace. By bringing about an innovative CPR based
business model to video ads using Augmented reality
\emph{call-to-actions} we bring the effectiveness of Google AdWords to
video ads that earlier to Hoot AR ads, only used to perform as poorly as banner ads
before. Hence Hoot AR ads with AR call to actions and interactivity, improves the effectiveness of plain video
ads, leading to a quantum improvement in video ad-spend ROI much like
AdWords improved the ROI of web based banner ads, laying the
foundation for a billion dollar ads business.
