Video Ads have been priced historically based on CPM model for impressions as it has been nearly impossible to know how much of these video ads lead to a product sale or if they even positively improve the ad-spend ROI to advertisers. Viewers do not know what action to take and how leaving them confused to figure out how to follow up on the video ad they just saw, leading to viewer drop off and poor ad performance. Hence it has not been easy  to measure effectiveness and performance of video ads historically.

Using interactive \textbf{Hoot AR} augmented reality  ads with obvious
call to actions i.e., buy button or rent button below the
interactive Hoot AR ad, sales can be generated immediately
after the viewer interacts with the Hoot AR ad. Payments or micro-payments are collected using crypto-currency such as bitcoin, eth, litecoin and monero. Hoot is now able to
price the ads based on sales referred from the user interaction with AR ad(referrals). So instead of ROI blind pricing based on CPM/impressions we can
price ROI aware based on  cost per referral(\textbf{CPR}). The CPR price becomes
the signal that drives the continuous Vickrey auction engine that powers the
Hoot ad marketplace emphasizing the importance of ad-spend ROI. By bringing about an innovative CPR based
business model to video ads using Augmented reality
\emph{call-to-actions} we bring the effectiveness of Google AdWords to
video ads that earlier only used to perform as poorly as banner ads. Hence Hoot AR ads with AR call to actions and interactivity, improves the effectiveness of plain video
ads, leading to a quantum improvement in video ad-spend ROI very much like
AdWords improved the ROI of web based banner ads, laying the
foundation for a multi-billion dollar ads business.
