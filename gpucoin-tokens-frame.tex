\begin{frame}[t]{ Hoot GPUcoin Tokens }
 
 
\includegraphics[scale=0.2]{static/hootcoin} Decentralized hoot nodes will earn crypto-token incentives called Hoot GPUcoins 
 

 \begin{itemize}
 \item for contributing their processing power \& bandwidth in the service of mining, GPU compute, encoding \& distributing video using the Hoot GPUCoin Live virtual machine 
 \item for participating in the Hoot GPUCoin security protocol
 \item much like miners in Bitcoin \& Ethereum earn token for mining the cryptocurrency in exchange for breaking complex math puzzles
 \item Hoot GPUcoin tokens are paid API keys not securities you can redeem Hoot GPUcoin tokens for compute time/bandwidth on the decentralized Hoot GPUCoin compute network
 \end{itemize}
