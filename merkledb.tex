The blockchain currently cannot in its current avatars store Equifax type of reputation database in a decentralized fashion, as there are no decentralized trustless anonymized peer to peer reputation databases, where anyone may add trust/credit/metadata scores but no one may remove data, but GPUCoin has a superior decentralized crypto solution to the Equifax hacks with our own GPC Trust \& Reputation DB \textbf{MerkleDB} to the Equifax problem designed using the best practices of cryptography \& computer science fundamentals including GPG public/private key anonymity, Merkle trees to efficiently download/query trust/credit scores, \& mathematically ensure integrity of encrypted anonymized data including identity and their trust/credit scores.

We address this widespread Equifax\footnote{http://fortune.com/2017/10/01/blockchain-equifax/} hack concern as GPUCoin has a market place component \& we need a reliable censorship resistant identity \& reputation database to support reliable credit worthiness and trust. We believe that centralized systems such as Equifax are long obsolete \& need to be replaced by multiple decentralized trust/reputation databases, one, hopefully the most important among them being the MerkleDB, the trust \& reputation database for the decentralize crypto-block-chain web. 

But since MerkledDB is designed to be open, where anyone may democratically add but no one may remove, all identities and trust scores are hashed/anonymized using GPG public keys and only if you permit [via your anonymous private key stored encrypted in your private device] a third party you authorize to view your scores may they download and view your scores. We make the ability to download only your scores efficient, as the GPC Trust \& Reputation DB MerkleDB grows large in size[imagine GBs in size \& millions of users in identity count], using Merkle trees a solid verifiable data-structure that is one of the strong under-pinnings of the Bitcoin block-chain SPV clients. Hence a wide ranging breach like Equifax would be mathematically impossible in the MerkleDB, GPUCoin trust \& reputation database.
And since all identities are anonymized using GPG public keys they have the added benefit of being censorship resistant as well. We plan to build our own GPUCoin P2P trust \& reputation database for supporting GPUCoin market place economics \& commerce initially but once its perfected \& gains traction, we will open source it to other block-chain networks as well which we hope will be another valuable foundational layer contribution as crypto reputation/trust db layer will support more efficient crypto commerce \& economics. We believe by providing such foundational fat protocols including the GPUCoin distributed compute layer and complementary GPC trust/reputation database MerkleDB layer we will substantially increase the overall GDP of the crypto-currency market.
