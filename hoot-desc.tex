Hoot Live is building the first protocol for decentralized delivery of videos. At the core of its patent-pending approach, Hoot Live removes a number of high cost processes to deliver video in real-time. Today video delivery requires integrating expensive video players, streaming servers and encoders from third party companies (such as Adobe) and delivering the content over expensive, centralized delivery networks (“CDNs”) (such as Akamai) to speedup live video playback. The existing process not only depends on a decades old architecture with expensive licensing costs but it suffers from high latency in its delivery. Hoot’s completely new approach eliminates the need for and high costs of a third party CDN, video player and streaming server. Instead it will depend on a new architecture and use a decentralized peer-to-peer network to provide near real time delivery. The costs of running the Hoot Live network will be even further reduced vis a vis competitors because cryptocurrency GPUcoin proof of stake network will incentivize Hoot Live nodes and users to contribute their excess processing power and bandwidth.
This network of decentralized nodes of GPUs will be extended to build an open source protocol for applications that leverage GPUs such as AI Training, Machine Learning, Genome Sequencing, and Rendering.
